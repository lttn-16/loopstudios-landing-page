## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I take this challenge from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) to practise my coding skills!

Here you can see all my solutions at Frontend Mentor: https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/lttn-16

In this challenge, I use HTML CSS and jQuery.

I've just made responsive for some specific devices, I hope you will enjoy it.

Thank you for reading! ðŸ˜Š
